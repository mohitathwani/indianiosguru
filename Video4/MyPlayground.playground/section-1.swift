//Integers:
//Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8,16,32,64 bit forms
//The naming convention is similar to C
//For e.g:
//UInt8 -> unsigned 8 bit int
//Int32 -> signed 32 bit int

var someX:UInt8 = 150

//The Int type:
//Int has the same size as the current platforms word size.
//32 bit platform -> translated to Int32
//64 bit platform -> translated to Int64
//
//32 bit platform -> UInt32
//64 bit platform -> UInt64

let someInt:Int = 50

//Floating point numbers
//Double -> 64 bit floating point number
//Float -> 32 bit ploating pointnumber

var someDouble:Double = 12.456372829
let someFloat:Float = 3.13457594

//Double is always used in Type Inference
var asd = 4.132

//Integer-Float conversion
let intPi = Int(pi)

let decimalPartOfPi = 0.14159

//Type Aliases
typealias CustomInt = Int

//Bool -> true / false

//Tuples
//Tuples are a way to group multiple values into a single compound structure
let circle = (20,30,50)
let nameX = ("Steve", "Jobs")

//Tuples can be created with any combination of data types like: (Int, String, Int), (Float, String), (String, String, Int), etc..

//To decompose a tuple, we use the following:
let (X, Y, radius) = circle
println("X is \(X), y is \(Y), radius is \(radius)")

//We can even name the individual elements when the tuple is defined.
var newCircle = (x: 20, y: 30, radius: 50)
println("\(newCircle.x), \(newCircle.y), \(newCircle.radius)")

//Video2
//Optionals
//We use optionals when we are not sure if something may or may not have a value
//To understand optionals, we'll take the example of the "toInt" ethod of the String type
//Option click on convertedInt and you will see the type is Int?
//It basically means that convertedInt can either have an int stored in it or it can be nil
let  intAsString = "123"
let convertedInt = intAsString.toInt()

//Try to set nil to a non-optional data type. You'll see that it is just not possible.
//var something:String
//something = nil

//By default optionals start of as nil. If you only want to declare an optional and set it's value later, make sure you declare it as a var and not let
//var theThing:Float?

//Unwrapping an optional
//We can use an if statement and forced unwrapping to unwrap an optional
//Force unwrapping an optional which is nil will cause a runtime error. Always use the if condition to be safe.
if convertedInt != nil {
    println("The actual number is \(convertedInt!)") //See the ! in front of the variable name. That's forced unwrapping.
}

//Optional Binding
//We use optional binding to check if an optional has a value and if it does, we store it in a temporary variable
//I always put the "u" in front of the temporary variable so that I know it is the unwrapped variable.
if let uConvertedInt = convertedInt {
    println("The actual number is \(uConvertedInt)")
}
else {
    println("convertedInt is nil")
}

//Implicity unwrapped Optioanls
//Sometimes, we might know for a fact that an optional will always have a value, and therefore, there's no need to check and unwrap the value every time we want to access it
//Implicitly unwrapped optionals are declared with a ! rather than with ?
//If somethingX was set to nil, the call to countElements would cause a runtime error.
//Also notice that I do not have to unwrap the variable in the call to countElements as the variable is implicitly unwrapped
let somethingX:String! = "Hello!"
countElements(somethingX)

//Video3
//Swift supports most of the standard operators available in C and also improves capabilities of some of them.
//For e.g, the == operator can be used to compare strings.

//Types of operators:
//->Unary: work on a single operand. For e.g, !, ++, --
//->Binary: work on two operands. For e.g, +,-,*,/,%, etc
//->Ternery: operates on three operands and there's only one sunch operator. For e.g, ?:

//Unary Operators:
let someBool = false
!someBool

var apple = 1
++apple
apple--
apple

//Binary Operators
apple = apple + 5

apple = apple - 2

apple = apple * 3

apple = apple/4

apple = apple % 2

//Swift also has Comparison operators which are basically binary operators
//Each of the comparison operators returns a Bool value
apple == 5
apple != 6
apple > 2
apple < 4
apple >= 3
apple <= 6

//== can also be used with Strings
let nameXY = "Steve"
nameXY == "Steve" //try setting the name to "steve", ie, lower case s

//Ternery Operator
//?: is the only ternery operator available
var isEven = (apple % 2 == 0) ? true : false

//Range Operators
//Swift has two shortcuts for expressing a range of values

//Closed range operator
for currentNumber in 1...5 {
    println("The current number is \(currentNumber)")
}

//Half-open range operator
for currentNumber in 1..<5 {
    println("The current number is \(currentNumber)")
}

//Logical Operators
//Swift supports the three standard logical operators:
//Logical NOT : !
//Logical AND : &&
//Logical OR : ||
if !isEven {
    println("Not even")
}

let hasApple = true
let hasBananas = false

if hasApple && hasBananas {
    println("The grocery list is complete")
} else {
    println("You've missed something!")
}

if hasApple || hasBananas {
    println("Either fruit is fine")
} else {
    println("You need atleast one fruit!")
}

//Strings and Characters
//Initializing a string variable/constant is as easy as:
let someString = "This is a string"
//Swift will use type inference to automatically infer the type of someString to be String.

//Initializing an empty String
//To create an empty String, we can use one of the two options available to us:
var emptyString = ""
var secondEmptyString = String() //This is the String initializer syntax

//Mutating Strings
//To be able to mutate strings, we should store the string as a var rather than a let
//So you can see the string concatenation can be done with the + operator
var mutableString = "Jack"
mutableString += " and Jill"

//Important thing to note about Strings is that they are passed by value and not by reference unlike most other languages

//Characters
//Swift strings are nothing but a collection of characters
//We can use a for-in loop on a String to print it's characters individually
for character in mutableString {
    println(character)
}

//We can also create stand-alone character constants or variables
let dollarSign:Character = "$" //Notice the double quotes

//Concatenating Strings and Characters
let string1 = "do something"
let string2 = " awesome"
var combinedString = string1 + string2

//Strings can also be appended to strings with the help of the += operator as seen in a previous example

//To append a charcter to a string, we use the append() function of the String type
combinedString.append(dollarSign)

//String interpolation
//Many a times we would like to print the values of variables/constants of different types on screen in a copmlete sentence
//Swift has a special syntax to do so: \()
let numDogs = 5
let message = "I have \(numDogs) dogs"

//Counting Characters
//The global function countElements() is used to retrieve the number of characters in a string
println("The length of combinedString is \(countElements(combinedString))")
