//Integers:
//Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8,16,32,64 bit forms
//The naming convention is similar to C
//For e.g:
//UInt8 -> unsigned 8 bit int
//Int32 -> signed 32 bit int

var someX:UInt8 = 150

//The Int type:
//Int has the same size as the current platforms word size.
//32 bit platform -> translated to Int32
//64 bit platform -> translated to Int64
//
//32 bit platform -> UInt32
//64 bit platform -> UInt64

let someInt:Int = 50

//Floating point numbers
//Double -> 64 bit floating point number
//Float -> 32 bit ploating pointnumber

//Tuples
//Tuples are a way to group multiple values into a single compound structure
let circle = (20,30,50)
let nameX = ("Steve", "Jobs")

//Tuples can be created with any combination of data types like: (Int, String, Int), (Float, String), (String, String, Int), etc..

//To decompose a tuple, we use the following:
let (X, Y, radius) = circle
println("X is \(X), y is \(Y), radius is \(radius)")

//We can even name the individual elements when the tuple is defined.
var newCircle = (x: 20, y: 30, radius: 50)
println("\(newCircle.x), \(newCircle.y), \(newCircle.radius)")

//Video2
//Optionals
//We use optionals when we are not sure if something may or may not have a value
//To understand optionals, we'll take the example of the "toInt" ethod of the String type
//Option click on convertedInt and you will see the type is Int?
//It basically means that convertedInt can either have an int stored in it or it can be nil
let  intAsString = "123"
let convertedInt = intAsString.toInt()

//Try to set nil to a non-optional data type. You'll see that it is just not possible.
//var something:String
//something = nil

//By default optionals start of as nil. If you only want to declare an optional and set it's value later, make sure you declare it as a var and not let
//var theThing:Float?

//Unwrapping an optional
//We can use an if statement and forced unwrapping to unwrap an optional
//Force unwrapping an optional which is nil will cause a runtime error. Always use the if condition to be safe.
if convertedInt != nil {
    println("The actual number is \(convertedInt!)") //See the ! in front of the variable name. That's forced unwrapping.
}

//Optional Binding
//We use optional binding to check if an optional has a value and if it does, we store it in a temporary variable
//I always put the "u" in front of the temporary variable so that I know it is the unwrapped variable.
if let uConvertedInt = convertedInt {
    println("The actual number is \(uConvertedInt)")
}
else {
    println("convertedInt is nil")
}

//Implicity unwrapped Optioanls
//Sometimes, we might know for a fact that an optional will always have a value, and therefore, there's no need to check and unwrap the value every time we want to access it
//Implicitly unwrapped optionals are declared with a ! rather than with ?
//If somethingX was set to nil, the call to countElements would cause a runtime error.
//Also notice that I do not have to unwrap the variable in the call to countElements as the variable is implicitly unwrapped
let somethingX:String! = "Hello!"
countElements(somethingX)
